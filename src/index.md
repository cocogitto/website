## Installation

### Cargo

Cocogitto is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cocogitto) :

```shell script
cargo install cocogitto
```

### Archlinux

```shell script
pacman -S cocogitto
```

### Nixos

```shell script
nix-env -iA nixos.cocogitto
```

## Shell completions

Before getting started you might want to install shell completions for `cog` and `coco` commands.
Supported shells are `bash`, `elvish`, `fish` and `zsh`.

Example installing completions:

```sh
# Bash
cog generate-completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/cog
coco generate-completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/coco

# Bash (macOS/Homebrew)
cog generate-completions bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/cog.bash-completion
coco generate-completions bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/coco.bash-completion

# Fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
cog generate-completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/cog.fish
coco generate-completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/coco.fish

# Zsh
cog generate-completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_cog
coco generate-completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_coco
```

## Introduction

Cocogitto comes with two standalone binaries : `coco` and `cog`.

Both of them and their subcommands have a `--help`  to display options and usage :

```shell
cog --help
cog changelog --help
# And so on...
```

Note that if you do not care about automatic release, changelog generation and just want
to create conventional commit message you can jump to the [conventional commits section](./coco_guide).

## Conventional commits  with `coco`

`coco` is primarily meant to be used as a replacement for the `git commit` command.
It will produce commits with messages respecting the conventional commits specification with
little effort.

**Example :**

```sh
# With git commit
git commit -m "feat: implement the parser specification"

# With coco
coco feat "implement the parser specification"
```

Using `coco` while working on a project using conventional commits is less verbose than good old git cli and prevent
typos and common mistake when writing conventional commit messages.

See [Coco guide](./coco_guide) for more information.


## Repository management with `cog`

While local commit are made with the `coco` binary, `cog` is meant to manage your repository both locally and in a
CI context. For an in depth guide on how to use it see [Cog guide](./cog_guide).

## GitHub integration

### GitHub Action

Anything you can do with `cog` and `coco` can be done in your CI pipeline with [cocogitto-action](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto-action). 

See [Github integration -> GitHub action](./ci_cd/#github-action) for more info.

### GitHub Bot

To help your contributors respect the specification [cocogitto-bot](https://github.com/apps/cocogitto-bot)
can decorate your PR with conventional commits status checks.

See [Github integration -> GitHub bot](./ci_cd/#github-action) for more info.
